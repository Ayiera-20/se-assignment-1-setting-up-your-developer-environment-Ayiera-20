# Dev_Setup
Setup Development Environment

#Assignment: Setting Up Your Developer Environment

#Objective:
This assignment aims to familiarize you with the tools and configurations necessary to set up an efficient developer environment for software engineering projects. Completing this assignment will give you the skills required to set up a robust and productive workspace conducive to coding, debugging, version control, and collaboration.

#Tasks:

1. Select Your Operating System (OS):
   Choose an operating system that best suits your preferences and project requirements. Download and Install Windows 11. https://www.microsoft.com/software-download/windows11

2. Install a Text Editor or Integrated Development Environment (IDE):
   Select and install a text editor or IDE suitable for your programming languages and workflow. Download and Install Visual Studio Code. https://code.visualstudio.com/Download
3. Set Up Version Control System:
   Install Git and configure it on your local machine. Create a GitHub account for hosting your repositories. Initialize a Git repository for your project and make your first commit. https://github.com

4. Install Necessary Programming Languages and Runtimes:
  Instal Python from http://wwww.python.org programming language required for your project and install their respective compilers, interpreters, or runtimes. Ensure you have the necessary tools to build and execute your code.

5. Install Package Managers:
   If applicable, install package managers like pip (Python).

6. Configure a Database (MySQL):
   Download and install MySQL database. https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/windows/installer/5.7.html

7. Set Up Development Environments and Virtualization (Optional):
   Consider using virtualization tools like Docker or virtual machines to isolate project dependencies and ensure consistent environments across different machines.

8. Explore Extensions and Plugins:
   Explore available extensions, plugins, and add-ons for your chosen text editor or IDE to enhance functionality, such as syntax highlighting, linting, code formatting, and version control integration.

9. Document Your Setup:
    Create a comprehensive document outlining the steps you've taken to set up your developer environment. Include any configurations, customizations, or troubleshooting steps encountered during the process. 

#Deliverables:
- Document detailing the setup process with step-by-step instructions and screenshots where necessary.
- A GitHub repository containing a sample project initialized with Git and any necessary configuration files (e.g., .gitignore).
- A reflection on the challenges faced during setup and strategies employed to overcome them.

#Submission:
Submit your document and GitHub repository link through the designated platform or email to the instructor by the specified deadline.

#Evaluation Criteria:**
- Completeness and accuracy of setup documentation.
- Effectiveness of version control implementation.
- Appropriateness of tools selected for the project requirements.
- Clarity of reflection on challenges and solutions encountered.
- Adherence to submission guidelines and deadlines.

Note: Feel free to reach out for clarification or assistance with any aspect of the assignment.




## Setting Up Development Environment

### Overview
Setting up my development environment was crucial for ensuring productivity and efficiency in my software engineering projects. In this task, I covered the necessary steps to configure a development environment suitable for coding, debugging, version control, and collaboration.

### Steps:

1. **Selected My Operating System (OS):**
   - I already had Windows 11 as my operating system installed in my computer.

2. **Installed a Text Editor or Integrated Development Environment (IDE):**
   - I already had Visual Studio Code installed as my text editor/IDE which I downloaded from [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download).

3. **Set Up Version Control System:**
   - I installed Git by downloading it from [here](https://git-scm.com/) and followed the provided installation instructions.
   - Next, I already had an existing GitHub account which I created from [here](https://github.com).
   - I initialized a Git repository for my first assignment by navigating to my project directory in the terminal and running:
     ```
     git init
     ```
   - Then,
     ```
     git add .
     git commit -m "commit message"
     ```

4. **Installed Necessary Programming Languages and Runtimes:**
   - I downloaded and installed Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
   After installing Python, I proceeded to install Django framework, a prerequisite for a project. I downloaded Django by running the following command in the terminal:
   <!-- pip install django -->
This ensured that Django was installed within my Python environment, allowing me to proceed with setting up a project.
I already had Dart and Fluter installed in my computer.

5. **Installed Package Managers:**
   - I also installed pip, the package manager for Python, by following the instructions [here](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/).

6. **Configured a Database (MySQL):**
   - I downloaded and installed the MySQL database from [here](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/windows/installer/5.7.html) and followed the installation instructions provided.

7. **Set Up Development Environments and Virtualization:**
   - I considered using Docker that will help me isolate project dependencies and ensure consistent environments across different machines.

8. **Explored Extensions and Plugins:**
   - I explored available extensions and plugins for Visual Studio Code to enhance functionality, such as syntax highlighting, linting, code formatting, and version control integration.


### Reflection:
Setting up Django posed some challenges during the installation process. Initially, I encountered difficulties with ensuring compatibility between Django and my existing Python environment. This caused some confusion and required additional research to resolve.

Another challenge was dealing with dependencies and ensuring that all required packages were installed correctly. Django has various dependencies, and managing them manually can be daunting, especially for beginners.

Despite these challenges, I was able to successfully install Django by following the official documentation, seeking help from online resources, and experimenting with different configurations until everything worked smoothly.
